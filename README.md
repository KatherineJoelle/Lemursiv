# Lemursiv

This is the github repository for Lemursiv Project: a game and 3D representation of Madagascar in Decentraland.

Lemursiv Project is a nonprofit which has been developed to exhibit the unique ecosystem of Madagascar, focusing on lemurs. The project's goal is to replant trees in Madagascar and save its endemic and endangered species from the clearing of forests for farm land. It is designed to offer players a fun and educational experience and to increase donations to the reforestation of Madagascar. All donations are handled by the charity https://edenprojects.org/
